The data used for 2019 is avaiable on request form the SOEP data center (https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.678568.en/research_data_center_soep.html), SUF v36.
The data used for 2020 stems from a special Corona study of the SOEP (SOEP-CoV) and is not yet available. 
The reason is that the correspeonding project is third-party funded. The data will be made available to the scientific community in 2022 with the regular next data release of the annual SOEP waves.
